DeepL Translator Telegram Bot created by [@Doberman786](https://github.com/Doberman786).

## Idea
The main idea of the project, to create a Telegram bot for easy and fast translation of text into different languages.

## MVP Scope
For me as a user, I don't want to have to open a separate app or website every time I want to translate something 
I've read in Telegram in order to do that. I want to do it without leaving the app.

# How it works
The Telegram user starts the bot by entering the `/start` command. After this command, the user will be saved to the
database. Further communication with the bot occurs by means of commands, which can be seen by writing bot `/help`.

# Getting Started
## Necessary parameters for running the bot
### Generate Telegram API Token
To generate your own telegram token, you can use the [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) and generate the bot's name and token.
Otherwise, follow [this instruction](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial).

### Generate DeepL API Token
To generate a token, follow this [link](https://www.deepl.com/pro-api?cta=header-pro-api/)

### Insert tokens into the code
You need to put the tokens into the code by following these steps:

- Replace `bot.token` [In this properties file](src/main/resources/application.properties) with your own token.
``` properties
# Put your BOT_TOKEN here
bot.token=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
```
- Replace `bot.name` [as well](src/main/resources/application.properties).
``` properties
# Put your BOT_NAME here
bot.name=YOUR_BOT_NAME
```
- Replace `authKey` [here](src/main/java/com/telegrambot/deepl/service/TranslateMessageService.java)
``` java
private static final String authKey = YOUR_AUTH_KEY // Put your DEEPL_AUTH_KEY here
```
- Do the same steps for [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) and [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) if you want to use a Docker.

If you want to use your personal database, you will also need to change the appropriate fields in all of the above files.

# Development
For development use `docker-compose.yml` file. Required software:
 - docker
 - docker-compose

You should run command:
```
docker-compose up
```
# Cloud Server
This bot is running on the [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com), a leading cloud services provider that offers a wide range of scalable and reliable solutions for deploying applications.

- RDS (Relational Database Service) - A fully managed and scalable relational database service that automates time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. RDS is used to host the PostgreSQL database for storing registered users.
- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) - A flexible and resizable compute capacity in the cloud that allows you to easily scale your application based on demand. EC2 instances are used to host the Spring Boot application, providing the necessary resources for efficient performance and high availability.
- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) - A virtual network that provides a secure and isolated environment for your AWS resources. The VPC allows you to control and customize your network configuration, ensuring that your bot, RDS, and EC2 instances are protected from unauthorized access and potential security threats.

# Technology Stack
- Maven - Project build system.
- Spring Boot - As a skeleton framework.
- Hibernate - Communication with the database.
- PostgreSQL - Database for storing registered users.
- Docker - Containerization platform for packaging, distributing, and running the application consistently across environments.
- AWS - Cloud services provider offering scalable infrastructure, storage, and database solutions to deploy and manage the application with high availability and performance.
- Telegram API - Telegram API to interact directly with the bot. Access to all functions of the bot.
- DeepL API - The DeepL translator API for implementing the translation function on a third-party service.
